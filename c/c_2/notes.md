# C2 - OTA Failure Modes

## Enumerate common failure scenarios during OTA update. 
My first approach is to answer this with my little knowledge.<BR>
Therefore, I'd assume the following problems <BR>
Problems to connect with remote devices, or loss of connection during download phase. Anything related to connection. <BR>
Besides, flashing issues. Some power breakdown during flashing process, how to recover from this <BR>
Also, a faulty image flashed leading to no boot or constant resets. <BR>
Finally, cybersecurity problems like malicious device sniffing the established connection <BR>

## Suggest mechanisms to ensure device resilience.
Based on research the following mechanisms are suggested <BR>

Software validation: extensive pre-deployment test and simulated OTA in local devices as to mitigate bricked devices <BR>
Partitioning: Devices must have sufficient storage for dual-image updates or fallback mechanisms, ensuring that a failed update does not leave a device unusable. The system is running in one partition while the ohter is updated <BR>
Updated data backup <BR>
Cybersecurity: ensure to follow most update standards of cyber. <BR>
Watchdog: to ensure the system doesn't freeze at any point during update or even if the new firmware fails to boot properly <BR>
